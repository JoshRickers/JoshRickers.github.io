 Before upgrading to 2.xx you will have to be on version 1.25.6 as this has the latest database changes that are compatible with the latest version."

      <p>Checking my Ghost installation recently and I noticed i was way out of date and needed to updated to the latest version of Ghost ( currently 2.11.1 ).

<hr>
<p>Before upgrading to 2.xx you will have to be on version 1.25.6 as this has the latest database changes that are compatible with the latest version.</p>
<p>And before any of these commands make sure you have backed up your Ghost blog by downloading the JSON file from the admin control panel &gt;  Labs &gt; Export your content.</p>
<p>You will need to stop and remove the current running Docker container. dockercontainer being the name you used for your container</p>
<pre><code>docker stop dockercontainer
docker rm dockercontainer
</code></pre><p>Now you want to run the Ghost image for 1.25.6. I chose to run the Alpine version.</p>
<pre><code>docker run --name dockercontainer -p 3001:2368 -e url=https://yoururl.com -v /path/to/ghost/content:/var/lib/ghost/content --restart=always -d ghost:1-alpine
</code></pre><p>Now go and check your Ghost blog to make sure everything is functioning correctly. If so we now can jump Ghost 2!</p>
<p>Again, stop and remove the current container.</p>
<pre><code>docker stop dockercontainer
docker rm dockercontainer
</code></pre><p>Now pull and run Ghost 2. Make sure to keep the path to your Ghost content the same.</p>
<pre><code>docker run --name dockercontainer -p 3001:2368 -e url=https://yoururl.com -v /path/to/ghost/content:/var/lib/ghost/content --restart=always -d ghost:2-alpine
</code></pre><p>Check your Ghost blog, it can take a minute or two to come back online but everything should be up and running.</p>
