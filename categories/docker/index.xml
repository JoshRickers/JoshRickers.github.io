          My previous post set you up with installing Sonarr on Unraid but that was as far as we got. In this post I want to show you how to set up Jackett and connect to Sonarr so you can connect to torrent trackers that are not oficially suported by Sonarr. This also works for Radarr and has an extremely similar set.
First thing first, lets install the Jackett Docker container. As always I will be using Linuxserver.

          Installing Sonarr couldn&amp;rsquo;t be any easier when installing using Docker on and Unraid server. Once you have the Community Applications plugin installed you are just a few clicks away from automating your TV show consumption.
Community Applications Plugin First thing first. You need to install the Community Applications plugin. You can find a guide on how to do that HERE
Shares Secondly you need to set up your shares. Shares are where Sonarr will be accessing your downloads and putting the TV shows on your Unraid server.

          I have been looking into what would be the best solution for a media server. Currently all my media is on as server and I have kodi access this via FTP. Kodi deals with all the meta data, TV show information and Movie information. This works well but when you start to add more Kodi clients nothing stays in sync. You need to manually mark your watched items on the device you haven&amp;rsquo;t watched them on or run up a MySQL server to keep track.

      <title>Upgrading Ghost 1.xx to Ghost 2.xx using Docker</title>

          Checking my Ghost installation recently and I noticed i was way out of date and needed to updated to the latest version of Ghost ( currently 2.11.1 ). Now usually this would have been the case of simply following the upgrade instructions provided by Ghost but because I am running Docker the upgrade process was slightly different.
 Before upgrading to 2.xx you will have to be on version 1.25.6 as this has the latest database changes that are compatible with the latest version.

      <title>Automate Movie downloads with Radarr and RuTorrent</title>

          Another step on my home automation journey is finding a way to automate movie downloads and streaming. Since I already have Docker, RuTorrent and Jackett installed I can use a fork of Sonarr called Radarr.
RuTorrent and Jackett If you have come from my previous blog post then you will already have everything installed and ready to go. Jump to the Radarr section below. If not take please take a look and you should find everything you need to get everything up and running - /automate-tv-shows-with-sonarr/

          Automating things in my life is something that I have been trying to do for some time now. Quick and easy automation is what I look for, especially for media. Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like having the latest episodes at hand to just stream whenever you want? I know I do and Sonarr provides just that.
We are going to take a quick look at setting up Sonarr, RuTorrent and Jackett with our friend Docker.

      <title>Docker, Nginx and Let&#39;s Encrypt</title>

          In my previous blog post I explained how quick and easy it was to get a Ghost blog up and running using docker. The next step is to set up a reverse proxy and an SSL certificate. I will be using Nginx as the reverse proxy and Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt as my SSL certificate provider. All with the help of Docker!
The Container There are many Docker containers available, some official and others provided by the community.

          I have been looking for a way to get a blog up and running in quick and simple manner. No installing and configuring databases. No installing and configuring web servers. Minimal user interaction when installing and setting up.
This is where Docker comes in to play.
Docker Minimal user interaction and you are using docker? yes i am. Using Docker will only require me to install Docker and use docker run .
