          I noticed that while typing out my previous post that Firefox was not automatically spell checking as I was typing. Coming from Chrome which does this automatically I thought this was something that should work out of the box.
It looks like you need to have a dictionary installed, language pack installed and the option to check spelling ticked.
Make sure you have spell checking enabled. Menu &amp;gt; Options &amp;gt; search for spell check.
