            Kodi is a wonderful media client and I have been using it for many years now. I have been adding more clients to my home recently and have noticed some slight annoyances. The main one is the lack of synchronisation between Kodi clients. This can be solved with a MySQL server keeping track of everything but I don&rsquo;t have anything running locally to do this. Emby and the Kodi addon Emby for Kodi has fixed the synchronisation annoyance.

            I have been looking into what would be the best solution for a media server. Currently all my media is on as server and I have kodi access this via FTP. Kodi deals with all the meta data, TV show information and Movie information. This works well but when you start to add more Kodi clients nothing stays in sync. You need to manually mark your watched items on the device you haven&rsquo;t watched them on or run up a MySQL server to keep track.

            Checking my Ghost installation recently and I noticed i was way out of date and needed to updated to the latest version of Ghost ( currently 2.11.1 ). Now usually this would have been the case of simply following the upgrade instructions provided by Ghost but because I am running Docker the upgrade process was slightly different.
 Before upgrading to 2.xx you will have to be on version 1.25.6 as this has the latest database changes that are compatible with the latest version.

            You can use a Raspberry Pi and some wonderful open source software called Pi-hole to block adverts on your entire home network!
I have a couple Raspberry Pis, an old model 1 and a newer model 3. The model 3 is being used to run Home Assistant (home automation software) and the other was being used to run Kodi but I now have a Steam Link which I mainly use for Kodi so the Raspberry Pi was gathering dust.

            In one of my previous blog posts I explained how to install Sonarr, Jackett and RuTorrent using Docker. This is a follow on post from that with some information on how to configure both Sonarr and Jackett.
I thought this would need a little explaining as I left out some details from the previous post as I thought it is pretty self explanatory but you can never be too helpful. I know it would have helped me a lot if there was a nice blog post or two explaining a few details when i was looking into setting everything up.
